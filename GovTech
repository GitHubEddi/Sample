Hi Kusum, Philip and Michelle,

Thank you for your valuable time, constructive discussion and offered opportunity to work private bank in London.

As discussed and explained, my promotion is in pipeline and it is delay due to ongoing hiring freeze and reorg within the departments in GCT, Singapore.  I would like to Thank for your review comments with valuable feedback on my skillset demonstrated of all seven round of interviews. I have been interviewed for C13 (Senior Data Scientist) role for private banking based on my experience and tech stack.   
However, it is downgraded to C12 (Data Scientist) role and it may be due my current title or career mobility guidelines.

Please refer my below ratings and use case with upgraded role via Citi career mobility.
